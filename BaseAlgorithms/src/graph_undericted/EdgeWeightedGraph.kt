/**
 * The `EdgeWeightedGraph` class represents an edge-weighted
 * graph of vertices named 0 through *V* â€“ 1, where each
 * undirected edge is of type [Edge] and has a real-valued weight.
 * It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the graph,
 * iterate over all of the edges incident to a vertex. It also provides
 * methods for returning the degree of a vertex, the number of vertices
 * *V* in the graph, and the number of edges *E* in the graph.
 * Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted.
 * By convention, a self-loop *v*-*v* appears in the
 * adjacency list of *v* twice and contributes two to the degree
 * of *v*.
 *
 *
 * This implementation uses an *adjacency-lists representation*, which
 * is a vertex-indexed array of [Bag] objects.
 * It uses (*E* + *V*) space, where *E* is
 * the number of edges and *V* is the number of vertices.
 * All instance methods take (1) time. (Though, iterating over
 * the edges returned by [.adj] takes time proportional
 * to the degree of the vertex.)
 * Constructing an empty edge-weighted graph with *V* vertices takes
 * (*V*) time; constructing a edge-weighted graph with
 * *E* edges and *V* vertices takes
 * (*E* + *V*) time.
 *
 *
 * For additional documentation,
 * see [Section 4.3](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/43mst) of
 * *Algorithms, 4th Edition* by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
