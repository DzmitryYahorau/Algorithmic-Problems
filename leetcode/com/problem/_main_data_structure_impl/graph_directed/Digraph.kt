/**
 * The `Digraph` class represents a directed graph of vertices
 * named 0 through *V* - 1.
 * It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the digraph,
 * iterate over all of the vertices adjacent from a given vertex.
 * It also provides
 * methods for returning the indegree or outdegree of a vertex,
 * the number of vertices *V* in the digraph,
 * the number of edges *E* in the digraph, and the reverse digraph.
 * Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted.
 *
 *
 * This implementation uses an *adjacency-lists representation*, which
 * is a vertex-indexed array of [Bag] objects.
 * It uses (*E* + *V*) space, where *E* is
 * the number of edges and *V* is the number of vertices.
 * All instance methods take (1) time. (Though, iterating over
 * the vertices returned by [.adj] takes time proportional
 * to the outdegree of the vertex.)
 * Constructing an empty digraph with *V* vertices takes
 * (*V*) time; constructing a digraph with *E* edges
 * and *V* vertices takes (*E* + *V*) time.
 *
 *
 * For additional documentation,
 * see [Section 4.2](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph) of
 * *Algorithms, 4th Edition* by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
